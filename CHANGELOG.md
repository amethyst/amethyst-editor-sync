## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* Panic if resource is missing. ([#14])
* Panic on Linux if no editor is running. ([#15])
* Panic if sync messages are too large. ([#17])

### Added

* `SyncEditorBundle::with_interval` to configure how frequently the full state is sent. ([#23])

### Breaking Changes

The state messages sent may now omit some or all of the data fields. Editors should be updated to
handle this case by not attempting to update their corresponding local data.
